## IF YOU EDIT THIS MANUALLY PLEASE ENSURE YOUR *Level VALUES ARE BETWEEN 3 and 100 and your *Time values ARE BETWEEN 0.25 AND 9.50!!
## IF THEY AREN'T THIS CAN CAUSE ISSUES
## shock defaults 
ShockDefaultLevel = 3
ShockDefaultTime = 0.50
## set MAXIMUM shock levels
ShockMaxLevel = 10
ShockMaxTime = 2.00
## vibration defaults
VibrateDefaultLevel = 3

## ROULETTE FUNCTION CONFIG
roulette_chance = 6 ## express as 1/x i.e. for 1 in 6,6. default is '6'
roulette_level_fixed = True # 'False' if you want to use any value up to max, 'True' if you want to just use default values. default 'True'

## it is VERY VERY Important to leave a new line AFTER THIS LINE
